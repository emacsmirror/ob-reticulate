;;; Commentary:

;; Org-Babel support for the R package reticulate, which enables use
;; of Python within R.

;;; Code:

(require 'ob-R)
(require 'ob-python)

                  (src-file result-file result-params))

(advice-add
 #'org-babel-execute:python :around #'ob-reticulate-advice)

(defun ob-reticulate-advice (orig-fun body params)
  (let* ((session (cdr (assq :session params)))
         (session-mode
          (and session
